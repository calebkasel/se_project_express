# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB we have created a server that allows for creating, retrieving and editing users clothing items. We have also added the ability to delete and like/dislike clothing items as well. There is an error handler that will send specific responses based on the error message that it receives.

To-do: Connect API
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

`npm run lint` — to run the linter and check for errors and warnings

### Testing
Tests and requests are run through Postman and Github actions
